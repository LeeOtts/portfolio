                        My name is Lee Otts. I was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. I just married the love of my life January 2022. We have 3 kids, 2 cats, and 1 dog. I am currently learning to program through NuCamp. The picture to the right was from a video shoot. Check out the final video under the "Videography" tab.

                    <p>
                        In 2012, I broke 8 vertebrae and had multiple surgeries to repair the damage. Luckily I can walk.

                        I needed to find something to do, a means of escape, and that is how I found photography. I started in the backyard with astrophotography because that was about all I could physically do. Slowly as I healed I started taking pictures of everyday life and then a friend asked me to take some pictures. Next thing you know I have multiple cameras, boom mics,  wireless mics, and built a computer to handle all that.
